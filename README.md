# Max side length

## problem
Given a set of two-dimensional points, the goal is to compute the maximum side length of
the square that can be drawn around each point, such that no two squares intersect,
except at the sides.

## input
Single file that has several test cases.
Each test case starts with the number of points on a single line, followed by each point on a separate line.
All inputs will be integers.

## output
For each test case, output a single number on a separate line.

## example
### input
```
4
1 1
3 3
5 5
6 6
3
-4 2
-3 7
-3 -9
```

### output
```
1
5
```
